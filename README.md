# jslib-starter-kit
JavaScript Library Starter Kit with JavaScript Standard Style, ESLint, Prettier Code Formatter, editorconfig, VS Code Settings, gitignore, and more...

## Features

This starter kit was builtin with:

* [**EditorConfig**](http://EditorConfig.org) helps to maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.

* [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/) it removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.

* [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/) a pluggable linter for JavaScript and TypeScript, configured extended with [**JavaScript Standard Style**](https://standardjs.com/) and support for [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/).

* [**Rollup**](https://rollupjs.org/) a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It uses the new standardized format for code modules included in the ES6 revision of JavaScript, instead of previous idiosyncratic solutions such as CommonJS and AMD. ES modules let you freely and seamlessly combine the most useful individual functions from your favorite libraries. This will eventually be possible natively everywhere, but Rollup lets you do it today. **More plugins Rollup could be added for a specific purpose**. 

* [**Babel**](https://babeljs.io/) a JavaScript compiler with support for the latest version of JavaScript through syntax transformers.
